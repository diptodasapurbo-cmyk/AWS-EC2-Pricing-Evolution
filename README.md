Introduction

AWS EC2 offers multiple pricing models: On-Demand, Reserved Instances (RI), Savings Plans, and Spot Instances.
Many beginners focus only on “cheapest option” without understanding commitment, reliability, and risk.
This project explores how pricing choices evolve with real-world workload requirements.

⸻

Objective
	•	Understand the true cost and flexibility of different EC2 pricing models.
	•	Highlight common misconceptions (e.g., Spot Instances are unreliable, RIs are always cheapest).
	•	Create a clear decision framework for selecting EC2 pricing options.

⸻

Background
	1.	On-Demand – No commitment, pay per hour, flexible but more expensive.
	2.	Reserved Instances (RI) – Commit to 1-3 years, lower cost, less flexible.
	3.	Savings Plans – Flexible commitment, discounts based on usage, can change instance types.
	4.	Spot Instances – Cheapest option, can be interrupted, suitable for background jobs.
